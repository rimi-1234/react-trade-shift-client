## ✨ Key Features


- **One-Click Import (My Imports)**  
  Import any product into your personal *My Imports* with a single click — quantity validation prevents over-importing and available stock updates automatically.

- **Full Export Management (My Exports)**  
  Add, update, and delete export products from the UI. Updates are persisted instantly and reflect across the site (create/edit/delete with prefilled modal forms).

- **Real-time UX & Secure Authentication**  
  Responsive, polished UI with secure user authentication (email/password + Google). Logged-in users stay on private routes after reload; no forced redirects. Dynamic page titles update per route.

- **Search, Filters & Pagination**  
  Robust search on *All Products* by name. Latest products are shown on the home page (6 newest, sorted by `createdAt: -1`).

- **Dark / Light Mode + Accessibility**  
  User togglable theme (dark/light) persisted to `localStorage`, with accessible contrast, keyboard nav, and consistent headings/buttons across pages.
